# ScribbleScrap-HTML-Source-Code
Hey, howzit goin? So, I made a platformer game for the Ms. Paint Jam 2022 called ScribbleScrap where you move scribbles and use them as teleporters to beat the levels. 
Now, let me state that this is a DEMO!!! The full game is coming probably November of 2022. Until then, here's the source code of the NewGrounds HTML version of the 
game. (BTW, I compiled it so u don't have to, so you're welcome.)
For further information about the legal mumbo jumbo of this game, open the LICENSE file in the main branch and read it and be enlightened.
Before you ask, yes, as stated in the license file, you CAN mod this game with the .mfa file.
